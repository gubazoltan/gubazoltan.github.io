> Every couple of years, I get the urge to completely revamp my websiteâ€”even though hardly anyone visits it. So here I am again, launching a new version and telling myself Iâ€™ll keep it updated while continuing my doctoral studies.

I used the [academicpages Jekyll theme](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) as the foundation for this site and chipped away the things that I found unnecessary at the moment. I took me some time to understand how the template works but I enjoyed the process.

I plan to start posting my random thoughts about stuff that I find interesting, such as books ðŸ“š, hikes ðŸ¥¾, cool numerical methods ðŸ§®, and Leetcode problems ðŸ’¡.
