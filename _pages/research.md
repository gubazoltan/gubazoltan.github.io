Research Interests
======

My research focuses on **topological phases of matter**, especially in non-interacting electron systems. I have also worked on **quantum computing** and **quantum communication**, gaining experience in both theory and practical aspects during my undergraduate studies.

Currently, my research centers on unstable topological invariants—quantities that, unlike the robust Chern number, can become trivial when the system's Hilbert space is extended. These invariants exhibit more nuanced bulk-boundary correspondence and require careful mathematical and computational analysis to understand their properties and physical implications. I employ both theoretical and numerical approaches to investigate their behavior and significance in topological phases of matter.

You can find a list of my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ye3t9aEAAAAJ&hl=en) page.
